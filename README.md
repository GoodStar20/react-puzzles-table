# Option 1 - Implement a Table!

This task has a bit less “figuring” out for the average Reacter - and therefore we will spend more time digging into your Component/API design. You will also need to spend a bit more time elegantly loading in fake/test data, which is considered part of the puzzle

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install the dependencies.
$ cd ./react-puzzles-table
$ yarn install
```

### Run the App

```bash
$ yarn start
```
